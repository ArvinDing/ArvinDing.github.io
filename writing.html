        Here are my some of my favorite works of writing that I've created.<br>

        I made this poem in highschool. I had a lot of fun with it.
        <div class="poem">
            <h1>Ode to Ramen</h1>
            <p>A Delectable Delight<br>
                A Godsend<br>
                A bright orange bundle of explosive flavor<br>
                Showered into a hissing inferno<br>
                Crackle, Sizzle, Crunch</p>
            <p>Screams fill the air<br>
                They Resist<br>
                They Cry<br>
                They Screech<br>
                But all to no avail<br>
                Their rigid backbones give away</p>
            <p>They gradually melt<br>
                Slowly marinated to a soft, supple hair<br>
                Silky golden hair from the angel<br>
                A childhood inducing aroma<br>
                with gold scattered throughout</p>
            <p>Including Tender, Rich Flesh<br>
                A worthy sacrifice<br>
                for a worthy meal</p>
            <p>Slowly slurped<br>
                First in small samples<br>
                out of curiosity</p>
            <p>Suddenly into clusters of thick thread<br>
                out of shear gluttony</p>
            <p>An atomic bomb of umami<br>
                Hidden in the broth<br>
                A mystical gift<br>
                Transcending space and time<br>
                A creation from<br>
                Blood, Sweat, and Tears</p>
            <p>Or<br>
                Simply,<br>
                A Savory treat<br>
                To be dearly adored</p>

        I wrote this in my writing class freshman year college. I'm pretty proud of how it came out.
        <div class="poem">
            <h1>Being Good</h1>
            I want to become good at something, anything really and not just good, but really
            good, like psychopathically, devote-your-entire-life-to-something good at just
            anything, just ONE THING, maybe because I’ve seen the respect prodigies
            demand, how everyone looks at them in awe wondering what there aren’t good
            at, where people just watch in wonder questioning where they got left behind or
            how they magically just have more time in their day, or maybe it’s to prove to
            myself that I can become good, that I can do something so well that no one can,
            something only I can do and feel proud in knowing that I’m doing something only I
            can do, or maybe it’s to make my parents proud, the ones who have always
            believed in me and my potential, the ones who have said that I could do more if I
            put my mind to, or maybe it’s because I want to advance humankind by being a
            pioneer, to leave my mark and be more than just a small fleeting segment on the
            grand scale and to stay in the memories of the generations that follow us;
            whatever it is, I really just want to be good at something.
